# llm-fuzzy-date

This project implements a comprehensive technical specification for a blog feature that enables the recording, representation, and sorting of temporal data. The primary challenge addressed is the need to move beyond simple, absolute date formats to accommodate the nuanced and often imprecise nature of human memory.

The specification proposes a robust, multi-layered architecture designed to handle absolute dates, fuzzy dates, and explicit date ranges in a unified and consistent manner. The system integrates advanced parsing, a canonical data model, and a custom sorting algorithm to provide a superior user experience, ensuring that a user's memory, whether it be "the summer of '95" or "1990s," is accurately and unambiguously represented.

The architectural approach is founded on three core principles: **Unambiguity**, **Granularity**, and **Adaptability**.
